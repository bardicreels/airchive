# ðŸ“œ Scroll: An old way to publish

Scroll is simple static publishing software whose purpose is
to demonstrate the pros and cons of Dumbdown for static
publishing.

## Installing

Scroll is part of the dumbdown-js package on npm

https://www.npmjs.com/package/dumbdown-js

```
npm install -g dumbdown-js
```

### CLI Usage

To see the CLI options type:

```
scroll help
```

## Design Notes

### Architecture

You use Scroll through the command line. A Scroll is a
folder with a specific project layout. Scroll compiles that
Scroll folder into a static HTML folder.

Scroll also contains a simple Node.js Express app for live
preview.

### Folder Layout

A Scroll project looks like this:

```
yourDomainName.tld/
 settings.map
 someDraft.dd
 readme.dd
 published/
  publishedArticle.dd
  anImageInTheArticle.png
  index.html
```

When you "build" a Scroll site, you are simply generating
the index.html file in the site's "published" folder.

This folder layouts let's you easily put any static
files you have directly into the "published/" folder.

Your sites static files, generated html, and published
article source dumbdown files, are all in the "published/"
folder and checked into version control.

The root level folder is where you can keep drafts
and any private files.

### File Formats

In Scroll individual posts are saved as dumbdown files with the
file extension "dd".

Entire Scrolls are saved as [stamp](https://jtree.treenotation.org/designer/#standard%20stamp)
files with the extension "stamp".

### Language

Scroll is written in plain Javascript. Instead of using
TypeScript, JSDoc TypeScript will be attempted. Much
ergonomic pain is expected but we'll see.

https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html

TypeScript may be used in the future, but for now a
design goal of Scroll is to keep things minimial and
close to the metal, and if it means slightly worse
type checking and docs.

### Git

Scroll is designed with git in mind. Articles are stored as
files tracked by git.

### Writing Experience

When you are writing you want to stay constrained to the
article's purpose. Each article has it's own purpose and
it's own history. Hence, each article is stored as a
separate file in git.

### Reading Experience

Being able to scan the page like a newspaper is a
very fast reading experience. This is central to Scroll.

Additionally, making it easy to take the content with
you, and transform it to better suit the reader, is
also key to Scroll.

## Questions and Answers

**Will you support publishing single pages for better SEO?**

No.

**Will you provide support to people that don't publish in
the public domain?**

No.

**Will you support newest articles flowing right to left
instead of having potentially older articles up top?**

No.

## Alternatives Considered

There is no publishing software that reads and writes dumbdown yet
so building Scroll was necessary. Jekyll and Brecksblog are 2 biggest
inspirations.
