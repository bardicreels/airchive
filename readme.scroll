title ðŸ“œ Scroll: Build your own public domain newspaper.

title4 Example site:

paragraph
 <a href="https://breckyunits.com/"><img src="screenshot.png" /></a>

title4 What makes Scroll different?

paragraph
 Instead of a page per post, like a blog, a Scroll is a
 <strong>single page</strong>, like an old newspaper.

paragraph
 Instead of Markdown, Scrolls uses <strong>Scrolldown</strong>,
 which makes it easy to combine languages to generate more
 creative content.

paragraph
 Instead of supporting licenses, Scroll is 100% focused on
 <strong>public domain sites</strong> and everything is
 designed with that assumption. We want to democratize the
 media industry.

title4 How do I get Scroll?

paragraph
 The instant way is to <a href="https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/publicdomaincompany/scroll">try Scroll in GitPod</a>.

paragraph
 Scroll is a command line app you install on your local machine. Scroll requires basic familiarity with the command line
 and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">NodeJs</a> >=14. If you do not have NodeJs on your machine, one
 way is to install <a href="https://github.com/tj/n">n</a> which
 makes it easy to get NodeJs.

paragraph
 If you would like to use Scroll but aren't familiar with the command
 line, please open an issue and we may be able to help.

paragraph
 Once you have NodeJs installed, Scroll is <a
 href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/scroll-cli">scroll-cli on npm</a>.

paragraph
 You can install the Scroll command line app by typing:

code
 npm install -g scroll-cli

title4 How does Scroll work?

paragraph
 <em>A Scroll</em> is a single folder containing Scroll files.
 Scroll compiles those Scroll files into a static
 index.html page.

paragraph
 Scroll is also the name of the command line app that includes a
 simple fs watch app for live preview.

paragraph
 Scrolldown is the name of a Tree Language defined in this <a href="https://github.com/publicdomaincompany/scroll/blob/master/scroll/scrolldown.grammar">grammar</a>.

title4 What does a typical project folder look like?

paragraph
 A typical Scroll project folder, excluding the html files
 built by Scroll, looks like this:

code
 yourDomainName.org/
  about.scroll
  publishedArticle.scroll
  anImageInTheArticle.png
  scrollSettings.map

paragraph
 The `scrollSettings.map` file let's Scroll know that
 a folder contains a Scroll.

paragraph
 When you "build" a Scroll site, you are simply generating
 the `index.html` and `article*.html` files in the site's folder.

paragraph 
 With Scroll your site's public static files, generated html,
 and published article source Scroll files, are all in the
 public folder and checked into version control.
 
title4 How do I save drafts?

paragraph
 Put them in a separate folder outside your published folder.

title4 What File Formats does Scroll use?

paragraph
 Scroll articles are written as Scrolldown files with the file
 extension `scroll`. The grammar for Scrolldown is fully defined
 <a href="https://github.com/publicdomaincompany/scroll/blob/master/scrolldown.grammar">here</a>

title4 What languages is Scroll written in?

paragraph
 The Scroll app is written in plain Javascript and
 runs in Node.js.

paragraph
 Scroll makes heavy use of Tree Languages. The CSS is
 written in <a href="https://jtree.treenotation.org/designer/#standard%20hakon">Hakon</a>.
 The HTML is written in <a href="https://jtree.treenotation.org/designer/#standard%20stump"> stump</a>.

paragraph 
 TypeScript may be used in the future but Scroll may
 never get over 1kloc so that might not be necessary.

title4 How does versioning of articles work?

paragraph
 Scroll is designed for git. A single article is stored as
 a single file tracked by git.

title4 Why is Scroll a single page?

paragraph
 Scroll is designed to make it easier for <strong>syntopic
 reading</strong>. Being able to scan the page like a
 newspaper allows you to read at a higher level. It allows
 you to read at a higher levelâ€”to get "in the author's head"â€”
 moreso than reading one article at a time from beginning to end.

paragraph
 Additionally, making it easy to take the content with
 you, and transform it to better suit the reader, is
 also key to Scroll.

paragraph
 Because Scroll is designed for public domain sites,
 we can optimize for the single page reading experience
 but people can have the full Scroll contents and render
 it however best suits them.

title4 Will you make design decisions for non-public domain sites?

paragraph
 No.

title4 Can I use Scroll for internal private sites not intended for publishing?

paragraph
 Yes!

title4 Will you support publishing snippets?

paragraph
 No. But will support making it easier for someone to do that in a fork
 or via plugins.

title4 Why don't you have only the newest articles above the fold?

paragraph
 This was originally a bug. But then it turns out to be a feature, as it
 gives older articles, which are often more important, more visibility.

title4 What were some alternatives considered?

paragraph
 There was no publishing software that reads and writes Scrolldown yet
 so building Scroll was necessary. <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>
 and <a href="https://github.com/breck7/brecksblog">Brecksblog</a> were the two
 biggest inspirations.
