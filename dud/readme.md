# Dud: Don't Use Dumbdown

Dud is simple blogging software whose purpose is to
demonstrate the pros and cons of Dumbdown for static
blogging.

## Installing

Dud is part of the dumbdown-js package on npm

https://www.npmjs.com/package/dumbdown-js

```
npm install -g dumbdown-js
```

### CLI Usage

```
dud
```

## Alternatives Considered

There is no blog software that reads and writes dumbdown yet
so building Dud was necessary.
