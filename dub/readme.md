# Dub: Dumbdown Unusual Blog

Dub is simple blogging software to serve as a demonstration
app of the Dumbdown markup language.

## Installing

Dub is part of the dumbdown-js package on npm

https://www.npmjs.com/package/dumbdown-js

```
npm install -g dumbdown-js
```

### CLI Usage

```
dumbdown
```

## Alternatives Considered

There is no blog software that reads and writes dumbdown yet
so building Dub was necessary.
