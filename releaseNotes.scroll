 The ðŸ”—link tag only supports single word links. Like everything with Scrolldown, you have
 a number of options if the conventional design doesn't work for you. Your options are:

list
 1. Link just one word. If you need more, perhaps camelCase or snake_case your words together into one concept.

 3. Use &lt;a> tags.
 4. Extend the Scrolldown grammar for your site.
